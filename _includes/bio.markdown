### Who am I? ###

I'm a software engineer living in Kansas City, MO. I write programs to build other programs that make the internet Faster Forward.
  
I've written some [music](/compositions). I've played trombone. These days, I'm President of [KcEMA](http://www.kcema.net), and Secretary of [No Divide Kansas City](https://www.nodividekc.org/), and Founder/Organizer of [Breaking In!](https://www.meetup.com/Breaking-In-Engineers-Helping-Engineers/)

I run long distances, lift heavy things, swim until I cannot breathe, toy with technology, and refuse to work on my own car even though it was my job in high school.

High school was a long time ago.
