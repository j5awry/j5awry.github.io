### Who am I? ###

I'm a systems software engineer living in Kansas City, MO.  
I write glue code, stick together APIs,  
And make developers' lives a little bit easier.  
  
I've written some [music](/compositions). I've played trombone.  
These days, I'm President of [KcEMA](http://www.kcema.net),  
Helping Kansas City electronic artists any way I can.  

I enjoy running long distances,  
Swimming for long periods of time,  
And learning as much as possible about everything.
