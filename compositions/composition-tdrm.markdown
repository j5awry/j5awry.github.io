duo seXny was started in New York City in 2013 by Swedish percussionist Patrik Samuelson (the se in seXny) and trombonist David Whitwell (the ny in seXny). Sharing an interest in new music, the group was coached at Manhattan School of Music by acclaimed violinist Curtis MaComber, and immediately began their first project, a commission for composer and Swedish Fulbright fellow John Chittum, resulting in their first EP, "TDRM: The Posthumous Music of John Chittum", available on iTunes. The duo seeks to strengthen and broaden the relationship between the musical communities of Stockholm and New York City, serving as ambassadors and bridges for new collaborations across the Atlantic.
